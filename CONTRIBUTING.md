First of all, I want to say thank you for considering to contribute to this little tool.
It is great that you found your way here and I hope you feel welcome.  

Following the guidelines provided here shows your respect for the time and work the people 
contributing here put into this project. In return, you may expect that the same kind of respect
will be paid when addressing your issue, assessing your changes and 
finalizing your pull request.

As this is an open source project I am looking forward to contributions in whatever form they may come.
Possible contributions can be code, tutorials, translations of the documents, bug reports or 
even blog posts.

However if there are any support questions, send me an e-mail to fraedric@fim.uni-passau.de 
instead of opening an issue. If the same questions comes up multiple times I will consider 
add a FAQ section to the README

If you are not sure where to start you can either have a look at the open issues, send me an 
e-mail or just dive right into the code if you think some functionality is missing. 

### Before you get started

Please also read the [README](https://github.com/FChris/godo/blob/master/README.md) and the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/FChris/godo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you get started so you have 
all the information I expect you to have.

### Submit a contribution

1. For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
    1. Create your own fork of the code
    1. Do the changes in your fork
    1. If you like the change and think the project could use it send a pull request.

If the changes are small or "obvious" fixes you can use pull requests or just send me a patch 
file which I will then incorporate.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
- Spelling / grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean up
- Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
- Adding logging messages or debugging output
- Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
- Moving source files from one directory or package to another

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

### Commit Messages
When writing your commit messages please try to stick to the guidelines given by 
https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

### How to report a bug 

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

* What version of Go are you using (go version)?
* What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead? 

### How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find that a key feature is missing simply open an issue here on GitHub which describes
what feature you would like to see, what the use case for the feature is and how it should work.
