A small go tool to manage my todo files

Note: This is work in progress and is not fully usable yet

# Usage

Godo works with a markdown like structure for Todo Lists.

Todos are sorted by date in the format dd.mm.yy

An Example Todo file would look like this:
```
  # 17.07.17
  
  [X] Todo 25
  [X] Todo 27
  [ ] Todo 2
  [ ] Todo 7

  # 14.07.17

  [X] Todo 2
  [X] Todo 27
  [ ] Todo 25
  [ ] Todo 7
```

Files are given to godo with the -f flag.

If you want to print all Todos in the file you can use the -p flag. For example:
  ``` godo -f mytodolist.todo -p```
  
If you want to print all Todos for a given day you can specify a date with -d. For example:
  ``` godo -f mytodolist.todo -p -d 10.10.17```
  ``` godo -f mytodolist.todo -p -d yesterday```
  ``` godo -f mytodolist.todo -p -d today```
  ``` godo -f mytodolist.todo -p -d tomorrow```

If you want to set a Todo to complete you have to use the -s flag and an id provided with -i:
The id indicates the i-th Todo in the list you would see if you printed it. For example
   ```godo -f mytodolist.todo -i 5 -s``` Switches the status of the 5th entry in the whole file.
   ```godo -f mytodolist.todo -i 4 -s -d today``` Switches the status of the 5th entry in the list for today.
   
Todolists stay the same unless a status is switched (or in later versions the description changes). Therefor it is 
suggested that you simply first print the list for a given date to find out the position of your todo and then switch the status.

# Further Work
The tool will be expanded to provide edit, delete and re-date functionality and the code basis will have to be cleaned up.
